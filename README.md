# Roofers-Knee-Data
Analyzing interventional methods to protect roofers' needs to assess which interventions are most effective. 

The data was obtained from the published results of the study done by the Physical Effects Research Branch (PERB), Health Effects Laboratory Division (HELD), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

The study's dataset number is RD-1108-2025-0 and data was collected from 9 male roofers performing shingle installation. Knee parameters including maximum flexion, abduction, adduction, and internal/external rotations were measured at all phases to assess intervention impacts through statistical analysis. Increased risk of developing knee musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is directly related to increased range of motion (ROM).
